					<p class="textBox">South Australia's wine region is located in the center of the southern coast of the continent. This state is the heart of the Australian wine industry and is responsible for almost half of the country's wine production every year. Despite the large quantities of wine produced here, the wines are still of extremely high quality, particularly in the region's Shiraz. South Australian wine region is very diverse in terms of its climate and geography, which means that a range of wines can be produced in the area. Several of Australia's most well-known and world-renowned wines are produced in South Australia. Adelaide, the wine capital of Australia, offers around 200 open cellar doors, which makes it the perfect place to explore and learn more about Australian wines.

					Evidence in South Australia wine region shows that the vines in the region were planted as early as 1836 by an English settler. This first vineyard of South Australia in Adelaide started producing wine in 1841 displaying a longer winemaking history than one might expect of Australia. The vines in South Australia are grown at varying altitudes from the low valley regions to the Riverlands, which are up to 600 m above sea level.</p>

					<p class="textBox">Kangaroo Island was separated from the mainland around 10,000 years ago. The first European to explore Kangaroo Island by Matthew Flinders in 1802 whilst en route from UK to Sydney. He named the island in honour of the feast of Kangaroo he and his crew enjoyed on the island. More extensive mapping (especially of the south coast) was done by the French explorer Nicolas Baudin which is why a number of geographical features have French names.

						While there is evidence of Aboriginal people living on the island as long as 16,000 years ago, the island has not been inhabited by Aboriginal people for at least 2,000 years. From 1803 the island was visited by sealers and whalers, exploiting the natural resources of the island. In addition, a number of "independent" settlers arrived - thought to be mainly escaped convicts and those looking for a lifestyle unencumbered by regulation - took up residence between 1803 and the start of official settlement in 1836.</p>
